# ReactDemos
**Setup for first time:**

Open 'my-react-app' project in VSCode.

Install the modules: run 'npm install'.



**Running Demos:**

Use the 'my-react-app' project.

Delete the 'src' folder in it.

Copy the 'src' folder from the demo you want to see.

Paste the chosen demo's 'src' folder into 'my-react-app' folder.

Open 'my-react-app' project in VSCode.

Use 'npm start' to run the application.



**NB: Demo '1-myreact-app - started**'

This just shows the results of using 'npx create-react-app' to set up the application.

To run this one, open it in VSCode, run 'npm install', then play with it.
